# netcat_simple
This is first netcat program

Simple - and based on Black Hat Python book. In time I will add own few update. 

Last time when I test this netcat - something been was wrong. Because server is running but client showed me a exception error. It had been almost two hours before I can saw an error. This was embarrassing, because error - have a form typo. Instead write "response" I wrote "respanse"... when I called print function. Okey - this is normal situation - it happens many times, and many developers but is very annoying. I add - I used a vim editor.
